## Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Be respectful, inclusive, and constructive.

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** 1.78 or later (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs))
- **Oxigraph** (compiled automatically as a Rust dependency)
- **Qdrant** (optional, for vector search; can use a Docker container)
- **Sled** (bundled with Oxigraph, no extra installation needed)
- **Docker** (optional, for sandboxed tool execution)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/doiito/gliding_horse.git
cd gliding_horse

# Copy example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# (Optional) Start Qdrant for vector features
docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run the test suite
cargo test
```

### IDE Setup

We recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) extension. Open the project root, and rust-analyzer will pick up the configuration automatically.

## Project Structure

The project follows a layered architecture. Here are the key directories:

```

## Adding New Features

### Extending the Skill Graph

If you want to add a new link type, skill node type, or evolution rule:

1. Define new types in `src/skill_graph/types.rs`
2. If it’s a new link type, add it to the `SkillLinkType` enum and implement its logic in the relevant engine (e.g., discovery, conflict)
3. Update the JSON-LD representation in `src/skill_graph/graph_store.rs`
4. Add tests in `tests/skill_graph/`

### Adding a New Batch Agent

You can create a new background maintenance agent without modifying the framework:

1. Create a new template file in `templates/prompts/batch/` (e.g., `my_agent.md`)
2. Add a configuration entry in `config/batch_agents.yaml` with a unique name, trigger schedule, and the template name
3. Implement the result handler function in `src/batch/handlers.rs` and register it in the `dispatch_handler` function
4. Add tests to verify that the agent correctly reads data, calls the LLM, and writes results

No changes to the batch framework itself are required.

### Adding a New Tool

1. Implement the tool logic as an async function with the signature `Arc<dyn Fn(Value) -> Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = Result<Value, String>> + Send>> + Send + Sync>`
2. Register it in `ToolExecutor::register()` in `src/tools/tool_executor.rs`
3. Define its JSON Schema and role permissions
4. If it’s an MCP tool, add the server configuration in `src/tools/mcp_client.rs`

## Coding Conventions

- **Rust Style**: Follow the official [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/). Run `cargo clippy` and `cargo fmt` before submitting.
- **Error Handling**: Use `anyhow` for application-level errors and custom error types for library crates. Avoid unwrap in production code; use proper error propagation.
- **Async/Await**: All I/O and tool calls must be async, using Tokio as the runtime.
- **JSON-LD**: Use `@id` and `@type` consistently. All new data types must have a registered IRI in the ontology.
- **Documentation**: Public items must have doc comments (`///`). Include examples where appropriate.
- **Naming**: Use descriptive, snake_case for functions and modules; CamelCase for types; IRIs in kebab-case.

## Testing

We rely heavily on automated tests:

- **Unit tests**: Run with `cargo test`. Place tests inside the module they test (e.g., `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }`)
- **Integration tests**: Located in `tests/`. These test full workflows (e.g., a complete PDCA cycle).
- **Memory tests**: Due to Oxigraph’s in-memory store, tests can run in parallel without conflict. Use `Arc<Mutex<Store>>` for shared state.
- **LLM mocking**: For tests that involve LLM calls, we provide mock implementations in `src/testing/mock_llm.rs`. Use these to avoid network calls.

Before submitting, ensure:
```bash
cargo test
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check
```

## Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
feat(skill_graph): add new link type for composition
fix(memory): resolve MESI race condition on invalidate
docs(contributing): update setup instructions
```

Types include: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Open an Issue**: Before writing significant code, open an issue to discuss your idea. This avoids wasted effort.
2. **Create a Branch**: Branch from `main` using a descriptive name (e.g., `feat/skill-graph-composition-links`).
3. **Keep Changes Focused**: Each PR should address a single concern. Don’t bundle unrelated changes.
4. **Update Documentation**: If your change affects user-facing behavior, update the relevant docs.
5. **Add Tests**: All new functionality must include tests. Bug fixes should include a regression test.
6. **Run CI Checks**: Ensure `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo fmt` pass.
7. **Request Review**: Assign the PR to a maintainer. Describe what you did and why, linking to the issue.

## Documentation

- **README.md**: Project overview, quickstart, and architecture summary.
- **docs/**: Detailed guides for each subsystem (memory, skills, tools, etc.).
- **Code comments**: Explain the “why”, not the “what” (the code already shows what).

## Getting Help

- **GitHub Issues**: For bugs, feature requests, or questions.
- **Discussions**: For broader architecture discussions or brainstorming.
- **Email**: Reach out to the core team at [glidinghorse@example.com](mailto:glidinghorse@example.com).

We look forward to your contributions! Together, we can build the most reliable Agent Operating System.
