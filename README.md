## What Is Gliding Horse?

An **AI agent operating system** built in Rust that orchestrates multiple agents via the PDCA cycle, enabling coordinated, auditable, and self-improving systems. — much like how Zhuge Liang's **Wooden Ox and Gliding Horse** revolutionized logistics by harnessing mechanical power across treacherous terrain.

> "We don't just build agents; we build the **infrastructure that harnesses their collective intelligence**."

## 📖 The Story: From Ancient Wisdom to Modern Intelligence

In the turbulent era of the Three Kingdoms (220–280 AD), the legendary strategist **Zhuge Liang** (诸葛亮), chancellor of the Shu Han state, faced a critical challenge: how to transport supplies efficiently through the treacherous mountain paths of Sichuan during his Northern Expeditions. Traditional wheeled carts struggled on narrow trails; human porters exhausted quickly.

His solution — the **Wooden Ox (木牛)** and **Gliding Horse (流马)** — were autonomous transport devices that could navigate difficult terrain with minimal human guidance. These mechanical wonders were not merely tools; they represented a paradigm shift — **autonomous systems that extended human capability**.

### Bridging Past and Present

Just as the Gliding Horse served as an **intelligent harness** for transporting supplies across impossible terrain, **Gliding Horse Agent OS** serves as an **intelligent harness for AI agents**:

| Ancient Innovation | Modern Implementation |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Autonomous Transport** | Self-directing agent workflows |
| **Terrain Adaptation** | Dynamic complexity handling (7 levels) |
| **Load Distribution** | Parallel agent execution |
| **Minimal Guidance** | Proactive anomaly detection |
| **Mechanical Reliability** | Rust's memory safety guarantees |

> *"The wise adapt their methods to circumstances, just as water shapes its course according to the ground over which it flows."*  
> — **Zhuge Liang**

This ancient wisdom guides our design: **flexible orchestration that adapts to task complexity**, rather than rigid frameworks that force tasks into predefined molds.

## 🔧 Key Highlights

### 1. HyperspaceEngine — Embedded Vector Engine
Production-grade spatial memory engine with **runtime-switchable metrics** (Poincaré, Cosine, Euclidean, Lorentz). Features **HNSW approximate nearest neighbor search**, CRC32-verified **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)** with 3 sync modes, **tangent-space pruning** for Poincaré ball search, JSON-LD metadata index with RoaringBitmap filters, and dual-space **hybrid search** (text × structural). A self-contained crate with zero external vector database dependencies.

### 2. Skill Graph Cognitive Network
Dynamic in-memory cognitive network with **6 semantic link types** (Prerequisite, Composition, Related, Alternative, Extends, Generalization). Includes **Poincaré structural embedding** computation from graph topology (prerequisite depth, tag fingerprinting), **hypergraph composition** with first-class `Hyperedge` and `CompositionType` (Sequential, Parallel, Conditional, Optional, Fallback), **graph algorithms** (PageRank, betweenness centrality, label-propagation community detection, DFS prerequisite chains, Tarjan SCC cycle detection), **causal failure analysis** with root cause inference, **formal invariant verification** (6 checks: acyclicity, link existence, composite reachability, no deprecated prereqs, valid 5W2H, valid security levels), and **temporal versioning** with snapshot/rollback.

### 3. Generalized PDCA — 7-Level Adaptive Execution
Dynamically selects from 7 complexity levels (L0 instant → L5 recursive → L6 emergency) via 5W2H metadata. One engine handles everything from instant queries to multi-week projects — no rigid workflows. **PA/DA/CA agent roles** with template-driven prompt construction.

### 4. CPU Cache-Inspired Memory — 4 Layers + MESI Coherence
First-ever application of CPU cache coherence protocol to multi-agent memory. **L0** Sled disk storage → **L1** session context → **L2** Oxigraph RDF + Blackboard → **L3** SPARQL projection cache. Intelligent prefetch engine reduces perceived latency by 90%. Solves context explosion and shared memory inconsistency across concurrent agents.

### 5. JSON-LD Universal Data Bus — W3C-Standard Interoperability
`@context` duck-typing eliminates field name conflicts between skills. `@id` enables zero-cost cross-agent entity merging. `@graph` named graphs allow conflict-free parallel writes across subsystems. Turns interoperability hell into plug-and-play.

### 6. Self-Evolving Skill Graph — Autonomous Learning
AA agents create **knowledge fragments** and new semantic links after each task completion. `/learn` and `/reduce` mechanisms enable autonomous skill acquisition and consolidation. `BootstrapEngine` ingests markdown skills from the filesystem.

### 7. Universal Knowledge Graph — Unified Cognitive Backbone
All subsystems (skills, memories, tasks, code knowledge) share a single **Oxigraph RDF store** via named graphs, enabling cross-subsystem SPARQL joins. Code ASTs parsed by tree-sitter are automatically converted to RDF triples. **Bidirectional SPARQL sync** from `SkillGraphStore` keeps the cognitive graph in sync with the semantic store.

### 8. Semantic Skill Discovery Engine
`SkillDiscoveryEngine` wraps `HyperspaceStore` for vector-based semantic search across skills. `suggest_links()` falls back from Jaccard tag overlap to cosine similarity via embedding vectors. Includes BFS path finding (`find_skill_chain()`), composition tree construction (`get_skill_tree()`), and conflict detection.

### 9. 5W2H Dimension-Level Audit — Precision Rollback
CA audits each of the 7 dimensions independently. What/Why fail → re-analyze. How/Where fail → re-plan. When/HowMuch fail → conditional pass. No more black-box "PASS/FAIL" — you know exactly what went wrong.

### 10. Proactive Perception Engine
10 execution triggers with 60-second anomaly deduplication. Monitors deadline violations, budget overruns (>80% tokens), role mismatches, environment conflicts. **Workspace Monitor** detects file creations/modifications/deletions in real-time. Auto-escalates to human when needed.

### 11. Micro-Tool System — Tame Large Outputs
Results >8KB auto-generate conversational micro-tools (e.g., "search_in_results"). Transforms unwieldy 50KB+ outputs into interactive, queryable artifacts within the LLM context.

### 12. MCP Integration — One Protocol to Connect Them All
Standard **Model Context Protocol** connects GitHub, Slack, Jira, and any MCP-compatible server. Dynamic tool discovery at runtime. Supports both HTTP SSE and stdio transport modes with repeatable `--mcp-server` CLI flags.

### 13. Checkpoint & Recovery — Crash-Proof Long-Running Tasks
Session state snapshots at critical points with full restoration on crash. Enables hour/day-long agent tasks and post-mortem replay debugging. `--resume <task_iri>` and `--list-checkpoints` commands for explicit session management.

### 14. Center + Edge Federation — Local Autonomy, Global Orchestration
Go Center handles workflow orchestration (Temporal), project management, agent registry. Rust Edge runs local LLM execution with Docker sandbox. VS Code Plugin provides real-time developer awareness. No single point of failure.
